#Welcome to My Neighbourhood!

This app will show you a few of the local places I like to hang out.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

GoogleMaps functionality was built with the assistance of [Google-Maps-React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-maps-react).

Additional images and data are provided by [FourSquare API](https://foursquare.com/developers/apps).

## Installation

To run the app on your local machine, please clone this repository into and empty directory.

Then, run `cd fend-neighbourhood-map-project`, followed by `npm install` to isntall all dependecies.

Finally, run `npm start` to open an new instance in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

In the project directory, you can run:


## Using the App

Once opened you can browse the pre-set locations I have added for you to get to know the area.

Desktop users can navigate the map using click-and-drag to move and scrollwheel to zoom in/out.

Touchscreen users can tap-and-drag to move, and pinch to zoom in/out.

Click or tap on a map marker, or on a location from the list to see more information about the venue.

Use the dropdown menu to select a filter.
